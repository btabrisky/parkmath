      <p class="Habits---Narrative-text">Often a problem that can
      seem particularly<br>
      perplexing can be solved by looking at it in a<br>
      different way. Sometimes the best way to keep<br>
      track of the different information and variables<br>
      in a problem is to draw a picture of some sort,<br>
      to visualize the information so that it is in a form that is
      easier to understand. You saw this last year as you solved a
      variety of problems, at times by constructing models, and at
      times by finding clever ways to visually represent things
      that at first seemed quite nonvisual.</p>

      <p class="Habit-Lesson---Problems---Single-Digit">Four trees
      are planted at each corner of a square park. The city wants
      to expand the park to twice its current area, but in such a
      way that the park is still a square, and none of the four
      trees is in the interior of the park. (The trees cannot be
      transplanted.) Draw a plan for a new park that meets these
      criteria.<br>

      to have two oranges fit snugly in the bottom, but there’s
      plenty of room to layer oranges above these two. If the

      <p class="Habit-Lesson---Problems">Craziola, the wacky pizza
      guy, has decided he wants to cut a pizza into as many<br>
      pieces as possible, with as few straight cuts as possible. He
      doesn’t care at all if the pieces are of equal size, he just
      wants to make the most number of distinct pieces.<br>
      With 1 cut, he produces 2 pieces. With 2 cuts, he creates a
      maximum of 4 pieces, no matter how crazy the 2 cuts he makes
      are. How many pieces can he possibly make with 3 cuts? 4
      cuts? What about n cuts? Can you find the pattern?</p>

      <p class="Habit-Lesson---Problems">Mr. Shimano gives an
      extremely difficult Japanese test. The highest score was 74%
      and the lowest 31%. Rather than give a retest, Mr. Shimano
      decides to raise the 74% to 93% and the 31% to 61%. For a

      think Mr. Shimano should give him after the adjustment?</p>

      <p class="Habit-Lesson---Problems">A hungry spider and a fly
      are in a room 30 feet long, 12 feet wide, and 12 feet high.
      The spider is on one of the smaller walls, 6 feet from each
      side and 1 foot from the ceiling. The fly is on the opposite
      wall, 6 feet from each side and 1 foot from the floor. Assume
      that the fly does not move (it is paralyzed by fear!) and
      find the shortest path that the spider can take to eat the
      fly.</p>
