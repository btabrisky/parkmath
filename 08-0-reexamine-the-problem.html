    <p class="Habits-Page---Text">to look at a problem slowly and
    carefully,<br>
    closely examining it and thinking about<br>
    the meaning and implications of each<br>
    term, phrase, number and piece of information given before
    trying to answer the question posed.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="story">
    <p class="Habits---Narrative-text">Some mathematics problems
    are challenging because they just do not seem to provide enough
    information to the reader to be solved. Often, though, that is
    because we have not looked carefully enough at the question and
    thought about what each of the words being used implies. To
    Re-examine the Problem is to look at each and every word, term,
    and equation in the statement of the problem and to see if
    there is more information to be gleaned from them if you look
    more closely.</p>

    <p class="Habits---Narrative-text">In the problem above, at
    first it seems that much of the information given is completely
    unhelpful and irrelevant. Although there seems to be
    insufficient information to determine the daughters’ ages, that
    should prompt us to re-examine the problem to see if some of
    that “irrelevant” information can in fact be used productively.
    While knowing the product of the ages is 36 doesn’t tell us the
    ages of the daughters, it does limit the possibilities of what
    the ages could be. What are the possibilities? And although we
    don’t know the house number, the census taker does, and yet she
    still cannot say for sure what the ages are. So, which of the
    possibilities that you listed are consistent with that fact?
    And while blueberry pancakes are soon to be eaten by the man
    and his daughter, is that the only piece of additional
    information you can get from that sentence?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="Habits-Thought-Bubble">
    <p class="Habit-Lesson---Problems---Single-Digit">A census
    taker came to a house where a man lived with<br>
    3 daughters. “What are your daughters’ ages?” she asked.<br>
    The man replied, “The product of their ages is 36, and the<br>
    sum of their ages is equal to our house number.”<br>
    “That’s still not enough information” the census taker said,
    after looking<br>
    at the number.<br>
    “Sorry, I have to go”, the man said, “my oldest daughter needs
    help making blueberry pancakes”.<br>
    <br>
    The census taker then promptly wrote down the three daughters’
    ages and<br>
    moved on to the next house. How did she know the ages? What are
    the ages?</p>

    <p class="Habits---Narrative-text">Sometimes, even when a
    problem does not seem to be all that complicated, we still find
    that there seems to be insufficient information. Often that is
    because we have not looked fully at what the words in the
    question imply. For example, although you likely took care to
    label the lengths of all 12 sides of the 3 squares, did you ask
    yourself what it means for A, B, and C to be collinear? What do
    line segments AB and BC thus have in common? It is easy for us
    to “read past” certain words without fully grasping what they
    are telling us. Carefully re-examining the problem gives us a
    chance to really slow down and look, as if with a microscope,
    at each individual part.<br></p>
