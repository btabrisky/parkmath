    <h2>Introduction: Three Challenges</h2>

    <p>Felix will fly into Birmingham tomorrow to visit some family
    members. Today, he has his Alabama map spread out over a table
    in the local coffee shop to determine the route he will drive with his
    pay-per-mile rental car. He has a cousin in Birmingham, grandparents in
    Huntsville, an aunt in Cottondale, and a brother in Tuscaloosa. When Felix
    realized that he’ll soon be served some of his grandma’s chicken
    liver-sardine-cranberry casserole, he gagged on his cappuccino and
    accidentally spilled the whole cup on his map. The only usable part of the
    map remaining is the mileage chart between cities. Here is the mileage
    between the relevant cities:</p>

      <p>In what order should Felix visit his relatives to minimize

    <p>Here is a map of part of the Middle East. You have different
    colors you can use to color in the different countries. If two
    countries are touching, then you should make them different
    colors so someone can easily tell they’re different
    countries.</p>

    <p>Kim is figuring out the schedule for next year. It’s tough,
    because out of
    thirteen electives, several students have expressed interest in
    taking more than one of them. She doesn’t want to schedule two
    classes in the same block if
    there are students who want to take both of those classes.</p>

    <p>In the grid below, an “x” indicates that at least one
    student has expressed an interest in taking both classes in
    that row and column of the grid.<br></p>

      <p>a. Assign each class a block (A through F) so that you

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>To determine Felix’s driving route, you probably recognized
    a way to represent the situation visually — whether you
    sketched out a map or drew a diagram.</p>

    <p>The second and third problems, however, didn’t have an
    obvious new representation
    to apply. Some people probably applied labels; others may have
    made lists. It turns out, though, if we use the method of the
    first problem with the second and third, we can learn much more
    from the data!</p>

    <p>Most likely, the diagram you used in the first problem was
    actually a graph. A graph, in its most general sense, is a
    collection of dots (called “nodes”) and lines connecting them
    (called “edges”). In your graph of Felix’s problem, the nodes
    represented cities, and the edges related the nodes by showing
    the distances between.</p>

    <p>We can represent the second situation with a graph, too, if
    we let each country be represented by a node. We can draw an
    edge between nodes when those countries border each other. Our
    graph comes out to look like this:</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/05-1-graph-theory/mid%20east%20graph.png"
      alt="mid%20east%20graph.png">
    </figure>

    <p>The problem now becomes to color each dot in such a way that
    any two dots connected by lines are always different
    colors.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="4">
      <p>What is the minimum number of colors you need now?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="5">
      <p>Did you think this version of the “coloring” problem was
      easier than in the introduction? Why or why not?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Similarly, we can represent the scheduling problem as a
    graph. The nodes can represent classes, and an edge can connect
    the nodes in the cases where some student wants to take both
    classes, as in the figure below.</p>

      alt="schedule%20planar.png">

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="6">
      <p>Solve the scheduling problem using this representation.
      What minimum number of blocks can you identify now?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="7">
      <p>Was this version of the schedule problem easier than in
      the introduction? Why or why not?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The tools you have been using so far in this lesson are the
    tools of graph theory.
    Already, graph theory has been über-useful in helping us
    represent relationships in a very streamlined way. What’s more,
    we can now see that the map-coloring problem and the scheduling
    problem — initially very different — are actually remarkably
    similar.</p>

    <p>In fact, the identically structured graphs of the
    map-coloring problem and the scheduling problem are isomorphic.
    Two graphs are isomorphic when each node in one graph has a
    “partner” node in the other — a “partner” with the same
    connections. For example, Georgia in the first graph and
    Astronomy in the second correspond to one another. So do
    Lebanon and Advanced Calc. This correspondence comes from their
    identically structured connections, not their actual position
    on the page.</p>

    <p>The following two graphs are not isomorphic.<br></p>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="../images/05-1-graph-theory/Not isomporphic.png">
    </figure>

    <p>An easy way to see that the graphs are not isomorphic is to
    see that node B has no “partner.” In the left hand graph, B has
    three edges coming out of it. On the right, no node has three
    edges coming out of it, so B has no possible “partner.” The
    number of edges connected to a node is a very important
    characteristic. The degree of a node (abbreviated deg(n)) is
    the number of edges coming out of it. So in the left-hand graph
    deg(A) = 1 and deg(B) = 3. What is deg(C)?</p>

    <p>Isomorphisms can be trickier to spot than we’ve seen so far.
    For example, someone else with the task of drawing the
    scheduling graph might have come up with the following:</p>

    <figure>
      <img src=
      "..images/05-1-graph-theory/nonplanar schedule.jpg" alt=
      "nonplanar schedule.jpg">
    </figure>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="8">
      <p>Check to see if this graph is still an accurate
      representation of the scheduling problem. Explain, in
      language a sixth-grader could understand, what you need to do
      to check if two graphs are isomorphic.</p>
    </div>

    <p>One final important concept that we will use is planarity.
    In the second
    version of the schedule graph, some edges crossed at places
    other than nodes. (For example, the edge connecting Animal
    Behavior to Shakespeare crosses the edge connecting Astro to
    Discrete.) In these cases, you can think of the edges passing
    under or over each other.</p>

    <p>Graphs where you don’t have to do this — where there is a
    way you can draw them without crossing the edges — are called
    planar.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="9">
      <p>Why do you think the word “planar” might be used?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Note that a graph might be drawn with the edges crossing,
    and yet be isomorphic to a graph that is clearly planar, as in the following
    two graphs (with pairing 1-d, 2-a, 3-b, 4-c):</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="../images/05-1-graph-theory/planar.png" alt=
      "planar.png">
    </figure>

    <p>In this case, we still say the first graph is planar because
    it can be drawn with no edges crossing and still represent the
    same information. Imagine picking up nodes 1 and 2, with their
    edges still attached, and “uncrossing” them to get something
    with the same shape as the second graph.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="10">
      <p>Draw a nonplanar graph.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="11">
      <p>Find some degrees of nodes in the Middle East graph.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. What is deg(Saudi Arabia)?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. What country’s node has the

      <p>A shelter needs to find homes for nine cats. The table

      needed to adopt all of these cats?</p>

      <p>Propose a criterion by which you’d be able to tell if a
      graph has an Euler path. Does it matter which nodes are your
      starting and ending points? Remember to examine a similar
      problem by making up specific cases for yourself.</p>

      <p>In problem 32 and the tournament<br>
      problem (see problem 48), you drew a directed graph — a graph
      where the edges are one-way. The question of finding Euler
      circuits is more complicated on directed graphs. Do some
      experiments and propose criteria for whether a directed graph
      has an Euler circuit.</p>

      <p>The following graph represents streets
      and corners; the portion of a street
      between two corners is a “block”. The neighborhood
      association decides to place streetlights at some of the
      various corners
      so that the neighborhood never gets too dark at night. They
      want there to be enough streetlights so that every home is on
      a block that has a streetlight on at least one of its
      corners. Assume that there are homes between each pair of
      adjacent corners. Find the smallest number of street lights
      needed.</p>
