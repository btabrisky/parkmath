      <p>When you have a diagram, it is sometimes helpful to Fill
      in all the Information you Can, even if you think it has
      nothing to do with the problem you have to solve. This is
      another example of tinkering. Doing this will help you to see
      patterns and to notice things about the diagram that you
      might not have noticed otherwise. It is a wonderful thing to
      do when you are stuck on a problem.</p>

      <div class="problem" data-problem-number="1">
        <p>The radius of the smallest circle is one unit. What is
        the ratio of
        the area of the largest circle to the area of the smallest
        circle?</p>
      </div>

      <p>In the problem above, rather than trying to figure out the
      ratio of the two areas immediately, it makes more sense to
      figure out some smaller, manageable thing about the figure,
      and see where that leads us. A clear place to start is with
      the smallest circle. Once we find the area of that circle, we
      can then find the square that surrounds it. Can we then find
      the area of the second largest circle? By looking at the
      smallest parts, we can see the pattern which allows us to
      solve the original problem.</p>

      <p>In your previous experience with geometry, you probably
      learned some basic facts about angles, lines, and triangles.
      For instance, two angles that form a line add up to 180
      degrees, and so do the three angles of a triangle. You may
      also know that, in an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite
      the sides that are the same length are also the same. These
      facts will help you with many of the problems that
      follow.</p>

        <p>The two marked lengths are congruent. Find the measures
        of all the angles in
