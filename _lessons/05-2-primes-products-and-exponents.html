    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>As you learned last year, factoring a number means
    expressing it as the product of two or more other numbers. For
    example, 40 can be factored as $2 \cdot 20$. Of course, 40 can
    be factored in many other ways as well.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="1">
      <p>What are all the ways that 40 can be factored into two
      whole numbers?</p>
    </div>

    <p>Since 20 can be factored as , 40 can also be factored into 3
    numbers as $2 \cdot 4 \cdot 5$; and since 4 can also be
    factored into , 40 can be factored into 4 numbers as $2 \cdot 2
    \cdot 2 \cdot 5$. You might also think of saying it could be
    factored into
    5 or 6 numbers as $1 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5$ or $1
    \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5$, but since those
    aren’t really
    different from $2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5$, we will agree that
    1 won’t “count” as a factor in the following problems, even
    though technically 1 is a factor of every number.
    Thus, at this point, 40 can’t be “broken down” any more than $2
    \cdot 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 5$(we are restricting ourselves to
    positive integers here, so we wouldn’t consider turning 5 into
    $2.5 \cdot 2$ or into $- 5 \cdot - 1$).</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="2">
      <p>Find two different ways to factor 72 into two positive
      integers. For each of your answers, continue factoring
      them until they can’t be “broken down” any more. Finally,
      rearrange each of your final factorings so that the factors
      are in order from smallest to largest.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="3">
      <p>Factor 210 into the product of as many positive integers
      as possible. Compare your answer with a classmate’s. Based on
      this question and on question 2, what generalization might
      you now conjecture?</p>
    </div>

    <p>A number has been factored as much as possible when each of
    its individual factors cannot be broken down any more. Numbers
    greater than 1 that cannot be broken down any more (i.e.,
    cannot be factored into smaller positive integers) are called
    primes. We say that the prime factorization of 40 is $2 \cdot 2
    \cdot 2 \cdot 5$, or ${2^3} \cdot 5$ for short; we know it is
    a prime factorization because all of the factors (2, 2, 2, and
    5) are primes. As suggested by questions 2 and 3, every
    positive integer greater than 1 has a unique prime
    factorization. As we will see, this uniqueness means that
    rewriting a number in its prime factored form will often be
    extremely useful, even though all we have done is written the
    same number in a different way.</p>

    <p>Sometimes it can be tricky to know what the factors of a
    number are, that is, what divides into it evenly, leaving no
    remainder. For example, what numbers is 153 divisible by? It
    would clearly be helpful if one knew easy procedures (known as
    divisibility tests) that allowed one to see if smaller numbers
    divided arbitrary larger ones evenly. As a matter of fact, the
    divisibility tests for 2 and 5 are easy (what are they?), but
    it helps to know the tests for 3 and 11 as well (sadly, there
    is no easy test for 7).</p>

    <p>If, when you add up the digits of a number, its sum is
    divisible by 3, then the number is divisible by 3 as well; on
    the other hand, if the sum is not divisible by 3, the number is
    not divisible by 3. So 14353 is not divisible by 3 (because
    which is not divisible by 3), while 55521 is. We will learn why
    the divisibility test for 3 is true later this chapter, but you
    might find it fun to ponder why it works on your own first!</p>

    <p>Some of you may remember learning in 9th grade that a number
    is divisible
    by 11 only when the “alternating sum” is divisible by 11. So
    4565 is divisible
    by 11 because is divisible by 11, as is 527494 because $+ 5 -
    2 + 7 - 4 + 9 - 4 = 11$, but 6587 is not because $+ 6 - 5 + 8
    - 7 = 2$-|
    is not divisible by 11.</p>

    <p>And now, a few problems to check your understanding of the
    above:</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="4">
      <p>What is the largest number (other than 495 itself) that
      divides evenly into 495? Why do you know it’s the largest
      number that can do so?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="5">
      <p>Is 4806 prime? How about 4807? Quickly name 5 numbers
      between 4800 and 4900 that are divisible by 11.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="6">
      <p>Determine the prime factorization of 2310.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="7">
      <p>Is 91 prime? How could you be sure of your answer?
      What about 221? Or 223?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="8">
      <p>Come up with a procedure that can determine, with
      reasonable efficiency, whether a number is prime or not.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Determining in general if a positive integer is prime (i.e.,
    has no factors other than itself and 1) turns out to be an
    increasingly difficult task the larger the
    number becomes. In fact, one of the most powerful ways of
    encrypting data
    on the internet — the so-called “RSA algorithm” — is based on
    the difficulty
    of finding the prime factorization of very large (over 100
    digits!) integers.</p>

    <p>Prime factorization also allows us to determine the answers
    to questions about the relationships between two (or more)
    numbers. Remember that it can be helpful to write the final
    prime factorization using powers; for example, the prime
    factorization of 484 is ${2^2} \cdot {11^2}$~ .</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="9">
      <p>What is the largest number that divides evenly into both
      216 and 270? This number is called the greatest common
      divisor of the two numbers and is written as gcd(180, 156).
      (For example, gcd(24, 36) = 12, as 12 is the largest integer
      that “goes into” both 24 and 36.)</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="10">
      <p>If your answer to question 9 involved testing out a lot of
      different numbers, try writing out the prime factorization of
      each original number (i.e. 216 and 270) first and see if you
      can use them to be more efficient in finding their gcd.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="11">
      <p>Find gcd(168, 448) efficiently. How can you be sure you
      have found the largest possible number that “works”?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="12">
      <p>Find gcd(${2^{16}} \cdot {3^4}$, ${2^{13}} \cdot {3^8}$), or put another way, gcd(5308416, 53747712). Looking at the
      original prime
      factorizations of each number, what do you notice about the
      prime factorization of your answer?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="13">
      <p>Create a procedure that allows one to efficiently
      determine the gcd of two positive integers. Check it with 3
      examples that you make up, where at least one of the examples
      is similar to problem 12 (i.e., where the two numbers are
      large but have simple prime factorizations).</p>
    </div>

    <p>Crucially, then, a prime factorization is important because
    all the factors of a number derive from the number’s prime
    factors. 24, for example, is ${2^3} \cdot 3$,
    and all of its factors — 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 — are made
    up of combinations of the 2’s and 3’s found in the prime
    factorization.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="14">
      <p>In the following exercises, learn how powerful prime
      factorization is by solving them without your calculator!</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. How can you check to see if $32
      \cdot 35$ equals $28 \cdot 40$ without determining either
      product?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Juniper says that when she
      multiplies $6 \cdot 24 \cdot 55$ it is equal to $21 \cdot x$, where x is an integer. Explain if she is telling the truth
      or not.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Simplify $\frac{{64 \cdot 25 \cdot
      14 \cdot 33}}{{28 \cdot 44 \cdot 15}}$ as much as
      possible.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. What is the positive integer N for
      which ${22^2} \times {55^2} = {10^2} \times {N^2}$?
      Copyright www.mathleague.com</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Is ${6^4} \cdot {10^3}$*} greater
      than, less than, or equal to ${8^2} \cdot {15^3} \cdot 6$?</p>
    </div>

    <p>The last few problems also are a reminder of the laws of
    exponents that you learned in middle school. Since ${5^6}$ is
    just $5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5$ and ${5^4}$ is
    just $5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5$,
    it makes sense that</p>

    <p>$\begin{array}{c} {5^6} \cdot {5^4} = (5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5
    \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5) \cdot (5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5)\\ =
    {5^{10}} \end{array}$</p>

    <p>Similarly, because $\frac{{{5^6}}}{{{5^4}}}$ r is just
    $\frac{{5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5}}{{5 \cdot 5
    \cdot 5 \cdot 5}}$, it makes sense that some pairs of 5’s in
    the numerator and denominator would “cancel” (because
    $\frac{5}{5} = 1$) and thus</p>

    <p>Lastly, ${({5^4})^3}$ is just $(5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5)(5
    \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5)(5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5)$, so
    ${({5^4})^3} = {5^{12}}$~ .</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="15">
      <p>By using the reasoning of the previous paragraph, finish
      the following equations, where x is the base, and a and b are

      <p>You now know how to calculate
      ${64^0},\;{64^{\frac{1}{3}}},\;{64^{\frac{1}{2}}},\;{64^1}$ 4 and ${64^2}$. Let’s broaden our horizons even more!</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Suppose a friend told you that he
      had just figured out how to calculate ${64^{1.5}}$. Based on
      what you already know about powers of 64, about how big a
      number do you think this is? Explain.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${64^{1.5}}$ can also be written as
      ${64^N}$, where N is a simple
      fraction. What is N?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Now further rewrite ${64^N}$ by
      using the property of
      exponents that tells us we can rewrite ${x^{12}}$ as ${\left(
      {{x^3}} \right)^4}$.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Using your result from part c, you
      should now be able
      to compute a precise answer to ${64^{\frac{3}{2}}}\;( =
      {64^{1.5}})$.
      What is it, and does it agree with your answer in part a?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Similarly, what would
      ${64^{\frac{2}{3}}}\;( = 64\overline {^{.666}} )$ equal?
      How about ${4^{2.5}}$?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Finally, what is ${7^{1.3}}$?
      Explain what it means to raise a
      number to the 1.3 power. Once you’ve done that, do the same
      for ${7^{1.29}}$.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="38">
      <p>One can also solve equations quite easily when they
      contain powers. For example, ${x^3} = 11$ can be solved by
      taking advantage of the laws of exponents and raising
      each side to the 1/3 power: ${\left( {{x^3}}
      \right)^{\frac{1}{3}}} = {11^{\frac{1}{3}}}$, the idea being
      that because the exponents on the left side multiply, the
      exponent becomes “1”, and so it simplifies to $x =
      {11^{\frac{1}{3}}}$(or $\sqrt[3]{{11}}$).

      Solve the following equations for x, keeping in mind the
      strategies in the paragraph above:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${x^5} = 32$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. ${x^{\frac{1}{5}}} = 32$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. $3{x^3} = 81$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. What is going on here? Explain
      carefully in terms of the prime
      factorizations of x and y. (Hint:
      Go back to questions 13 and 92e
      and look at how you were able to find the gcd and the lcm
      efficiently, and compare.)</p>

      <p>Sometime around 5th grade, you were taught to add
      fractions a/b and c/d by finding a common denominator.
      Assume
      b and d are positive.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Explain whether you should be
      finding the gcd or the lcm of b and d if you want to find
      their smallest possible common denominator.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. By the way, why do you need a
      “common” denominator to add fractions anyway? Why not just
      add them using different denominators?</p>

      <p>Let’s take a look at a proof the Greek mathematician
      Euclid came up with over 2000 years ago to show that there
      are an infinite number of primes. Euclid did this by assuming
      that there were a finite number of primes, and then showed
      that assuming that is the case turns out to be
      self-contradictory. Follow along to see his “moves”!</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. If there were a finite number of
      primes, we could call the largest one “P”. Euclid then asked
      us to consider “Q”, the number that has a prime factorization
      that includes each of the primes exactly once. Explain
      clearly how one could calculate “Q”.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Euclid then made his biggest
      “move”. Remembering that all the primes divide evenly into
      “Q”, Euclid asks us to consider the number $Q + 1$. Which of
      the primes do you think would go evenly into$Q + 1$ as well?
      Why?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. What can you conclude about $Q + 1$, now that you have established that it has no prime
      factors?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Why does your conclusion contradict
      what you assumed at the start of the problem?</p>
