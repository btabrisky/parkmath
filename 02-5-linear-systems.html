    <h1>Lesson 5:</h1>

    <h1>Linear Systems</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>In the previous lesson (problem 38), we were asked to prove
    that the three<br>
    medians of the triangle \[A\left( { - 3,13} \right)\] ,
    \[B\left( {9,1} \right)\] and all contained the point \[\left(
    { - 1,5} \right)\] , after first finding the equations of the
    medians. But what if you were not given the point ? How would
    you discover that point from the equations of the medians?</p>

    <p>More generally, given the equations of two lines, how could
    you find the point where those lines intersect — the solutions
    that the two equations share? The hunt for solutions that
    equations share is a useful and sometimes exciting quest, and
    can reveal interesting relationships between the equations.</p>

    <p>One could answer the question of finding a common solution
    by guessing, but there are times when guessing is extremely
    difficult. In this lesson we will explore algebraic methods of
    exploring common solutions to a set of linear equations —
    called a linear system of equations. At the same time we will
    use visual approaches to promote better understanding of the
    relationships between the variables, and the nature and
    existence of common solutions.</p>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Recall that the equations of the medians in the previous
    lesson (problem 38) were:</p>

    <p>\[y = - 4x + 1\] \[y = \frac{{ - 2}}{5}x +
    \frac{{23}}{5}\]</p>

    <p>For the time being let’s just work with the first two
    equations and try to find a particular ordered pair $\left(
    {x,y} \right)$ which satisfies both — values of x and y which
    make both of them work.</p>

    <p>Since the second equation claims that \[y\] is equal to \[ -
    4x + 1\] , it seems okay to replace \[y\] ꃲm by \[ - 4x + 1\]
    in the first equation.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="1">
      <p>What does the equation become when \[y\] is replaced by \[
      - 4x + 1\] ? Now solve this equation for x.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="2">
      <p>Substitute the value of x you got in problem 1 in the
      first equation to get the value of y.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="3">
      <p>Use your results from problems 1 and 2 to show that the
      medians all intersect in (contain) a single point.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The form of the median equations was particularly convenient
    to make the<br>
    replacement/substitution for y. Could you do a similar
    replacement if the<br>
    equations were written in a different form? Fortunately most
    linear equations<br>
    can be written in a form similar to one of the median
    equations. Take a look<br>
    at the following problem.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="4">
      <p>Find the point where the lines given by the equations \[5x
      + y = 1\] and \[x - 5y = 8\] intersect.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Note that from the first equation
      we get \[y = 1 - 5x\] , so replacing y by \[1 - 5x\] in the
      second equation should be fair game. Replace y by \[1 - 5x\]
      in the second equation and solve for x.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Use the value of x you got in part
      a and the fact that to find the value of y. Check to be sure
      that the values you got for x and y satisfy both of the
      equations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="5">
      <p>Solve the pair of equations in problem 4 by starting with
      the second equation. (Express x in terms of y and substitute
      for x in the first equation.)</p>
    </div>

    <p>By the way, the method we used to find the solution in
    problems 1 through 5 is called the substitution method.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="6">
      <p>Use the method of substitution to solve the following
      systems of equations:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. $x + 4y = - 29$<br>
      $3x - 2y = 11$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. $3x - 5y = 4$<br>
      $5x - y = 3$</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. \[x + y = 21\]<br>

      <p>Matt claims that he discovered that there is one
      particular ordered pair that would satisfy all three
      equations because when he graphed the lines they all met in a
      single point. Gabbi drew the graphs herself and said that she
      wasn’t quite sure. Matt could be right but she thought it was
      too close to call. Check Matt’s claim algebraically.<br></p>

      <p>After the class had completed problem 9 using the
      substitution method, Sophie (of course) proclaimed that this
      method was a waste of time and that Jeff had taught her an
      easier way, and that it was a lot more fun.<br>
      <br>
      “Simply multiply both sides of the first equation by 5,
      multiply both sides of the second equation by 3, and then add
      your two new equations together. At this point you are pretty
      much done.”<br>

      thing.”<br>
      <br>
      Check out Sampson’s approach.</p>

    <p>The method Sampson and Sophie used in problems 14 and 15 to
