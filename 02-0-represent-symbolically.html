    <p class="Habits---Narrative-text">In trying to solve problem
    1, some of you might have first tried a little tinkering.<br>
    The diagram does suggest that a side of the second smallest
    square might be somewhere between 6 and 9, and so you might
    have tried some or all of the<br>
    integers 6 through 9. As it turns out, not only do none of
    these integers work, but after trying any one of the numbers it
    might not be at all clear to you<br>
    whether it would be too high or too low. So refining the
    process to get at the answer might prove to be a bit
    challenging.</p>

    <p class="Habits---Narrative-text">On the other hand, some of
    you algebra lovers might have bypassed that<br>
    wonderful play and jumped right into some symbolic
    representation of the length of the side. If you haven’t
    already done so, give algebra a try.</p>

    <p class="Habit-Lesson---Problems---Single-Digit">Representing
    the length of a side of the second smallest square (or some
    other square) by $x$:</p>

    <p class="Habit-Lesson---Problems"></p>

    <p class="problem-part">. Work around the diagram, and find an
    expression involving $x$ for the length of the left side of the
    rectangle.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">. Find an expression involving $x$,
    different from that in part a, for the length of the right side
    of the rectangle.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">. By equating the expressions in parts
    a and b, solve the resulting equation for $x$.</p>

    <p class="problem-part">. Now find the sizes of all the
    squares.</p>

    <p class="Habit-Lesson---Problems---Single-Digit"></p>

    <p class="Habits---Narrative-text">Even though you might have
    been able to discover the answer by tinkering, you might also
    agree that the algebra approach was somewhat more efficient,
    despite the fact that it was certainly not a walk in the park
    and required a great deal of care and manipulation. Further,
    the algebra not only provided a solution that you could be sure
    of, but also provides a way for you to communicate your
    solution in a clear and convincing manner.</p>

    <p class="Habits---Narrative-text">Of course algebra is not a
    panacea. It is not the best approach for all such problems, and
    even when it is the best approach one still has to make
    decisions about which of the unknown properties should be
    replaced by variables. And even after you have made these
    decisions, you may realize that the equation you have written
    requires very difficult algebra to solve, so much so that you
    need to learn new skills to have any hope of solving it.</p>

    <p class="Habits---Narrative-text">In addition to its
    efficiency, security and its ability to communicate succinctly
    and cogently, an algebraic approach can provide you with a
    deeper understanding of the problem. In problem 2, for example,
    you might have been able to discover the relationship between
    the size of the smallest square and the sizes of the other
    squares, allowing you to see the solution for a starting square
    of any size. Using algebra can also allow you to investigate
    the possibility of multiple correct answers, something that a
    more tinkering approach is less likely to reveal.</p>

    that what you think happens in problem 3 always happens no
    matter what four numbers your start out with? You can of course
    produce a complicated verbal argument but an algebraic argument
    would be far more convincing.</p>

    your friends. Get $2.85 in change, and keep it in your pocket.
    Now, find a friend who’s got some change in her pocket. Have
    your friend hold the change from her pocket. For effect, you
    can have her jingle the change, and pretend you’re listening
    really carefully. Then, tell your friend: “I can tell, just by
    listening, how your amount of change compares to my amount. I
    think that *I* have exactly what you have... plus fifty
    cents... and then enough left over to make *your* change equal
    $2.35.”<br>

    will ALWAYS work! Why?</p>
