    <h1>Introduction to Trigonometry</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>The escalator at the Wheaton metro station in Silver Spring,
    Maryland, is the longest escalator in the Western Hemisphere.
    If you ride it you will travel a diagonal distance of 508 feet,
    which will take two minutes and forty-five seconds. You’re
    about to build a bigger one – your goal is to make an escalator
    with a diagonal distance of 520 feet. Before you can start,
    though, you need to do some planning. You need to figure out
    how much space along the ground your escalator will take so
    that you can prepare the foundation. Standard escalator
    construction rules require that:</p>

    <p>$•$ the steps each be 1.2 feet long.<br></p>

    <p>$•$ The measure of the angle between the ground and the
    diagonal path of the escalator must be no more than 30$°<br>
    $</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="1">
      <p>You start to build your escalator and measure a diagonal
      distance of 1.3856 feet per step. What is the horizontal
      distance, along the ground, you’ll need to clear in order to
      build your escalator with a diagonal distance of 520
      feet?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Development</h2>

    <p>Your solution to the escalator problem probably involved
    ratios or scale factors in some way. Here’s one way of thinking
    about the problem:</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="2">
      <p>If you haven’t already, explain how you know that
      \[\frac{{{\rm{1.2}}}}{{{\rm{1.3856}}}} = \frac{{{\rm{the
      required horizontal distance}}}}{{520}}\] .</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="3">
      <p>Use a similar method to find the height of the Wheaton
      escalator.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="4">
      <p>Imagine a large right triangle ABC with the right angle at
      A and angle $C = {30^ \circ }$ . Based on your work in
      problems 1-3:</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. What would you expect the ratio of
      AC to BC to be? Why?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. How about the ratio of AB to
      BC?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Go ahead and check your thinking by
      using a protractor and ruler to accurately draw such a
      triangle, and measure the sides. Convince yourself that these
      ratios are the same no matter how large or small the right
      triangle is, provided the measure of angle C remains
      30$°$.</p>
    </div>

    <p>As problem 4 emphasizes, certain ratios will always stay
    constant in a right triangle with an angle measuring 30$°$. In
    the escalator example, the ratio of the vertical distance to
    the diagonal distance is called the sine of 30$°$. The ratio of
    the horizontal distance to the diagonal distance is called the
    cosine of 30$°$.</p>

    <p>A third ratio is called the tangent ratio. In the escalator
    example, this is the ratio of the vertical distance to the
    horizontal distance.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="5">
      <p>If you asked your calculator to tell you the sine of 30°
      what do you suppose it would give you? How about the cosine
      of 30°? Tangent of 30°?</p>
    </div>

    <p>If you think of the escalator as a triangle with a 30$°$
    angle and a 90$°$ angle, you can label the sides as
    follows:</p>

    <p>There are two sides that form the 30$°$ angle. One is of
    course the hypotenuse; the other is called the side adjacent to
    the 30$°$ angle. The vertical side of the triangle is called
    the side opposite to the 30$°$ angle, since it is all the way
    across the triangle from the angle.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="6">
      <p>For each of the following, use a protractor to draw a
      RIGHT triangle with the angle given. Then use a ruler to
      measure the lengths and calculate the sine, cosine, and
      tangent of each angle.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. 25°</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. 63°</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. 42°</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="7">
      <p>For each part in the previous problem, use the SIN, COS,
      and TAN buttons on your calculator to see how close your
      estimates were.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Here’s the picture in general. We’re using $θ$ (“theta”) to
    stand for any angle, just like we can use x to stand for any
    number.</p>

    <p class="Lesson---Inline-Diagram"><img src=
    "images/03-2-intro-to-trigonometry/intro%20trig%20def%20triangle.tif"
    alt="intro%20trig%20def%20triangle.tif"></p>

    <p>If $θ$ is an angle in a right triangle, but not the right
    angle, then here’s how we define the three trigonometric
    ratios:</p>

    <p>Sine of $θ$ = opposite/hypotenuse</p>

    <p>Cosine of $θ$ = adjacent/hypotenuse</p>

    <p>Tangent of $θ$ = opposite/adjacent</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="8"></div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="9">
      <p>Using the two triangles below, find the sine, cosine, and
      tangent of a 70° angle, a 20° angle, a 35° angle, and a 55°
      angle.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="10">
      <p>Did you notice any repeated answers in your calculations
      above?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Make a conjecture based on your
      findings.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Try out your conjecture on a
      triangle that you create.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Can you explain why this is going
      on?</p>
    </div>

    <p>In the similar triangles lesson, and also in the escalator
    problem, you were able to find missing lengths in certain
    triangles because you had a second, similar triangle that
    allowed you to find the scale factor. One reason that sine,
    cosine, and tangent ratios are so important is that they help
    you find lengths in triangles even when you don’t have a second
    triangle to help you get the scale factor.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="12">
      <p>Here is a problem that allows you to “solve a triangle”

      35 degrees. Your expression will, of course, contain the<br>

    <p class="problem-part">. Find the length of the hypotenuse of
    the triangle.</p>

    <p>In the previous problem, you were lucky that you already
    knew the tangent of 35$°$. You are not always so lucky.
    However, your calculator can help you out.</p>

    <div class="problem" data-problem-number="13">
      <p>Press the MODE button on your calculator and make sure

    <p>Often, trigonometry is used to find lengths of triangles in
    the “real world” that are too difficult to measure
    directly.</p>

      <p>You’d like to know how tall a flagpole is, but you can’t

      away from the flagpole, you can see the top of the flagpole
      by looking up at a 22$°$ angle. How tall is the flagpole?</p>

    <p>Your calculator gives you approximate answers when you ask
    it to tell you the sine, cosine, or<br>
    tangent of an angle. (See <a href=
    "http://www.mathsisfun.com/irrational-numbers.html">http://www.mathsisfun.com/irrational-numbers.html</a>
    for more information and a juicy, though probably apocryphal,
    tidbit.) Sometimes you would rather know the answer<br>
    exactly. Some geometry can help you do this.</p>

    <p>Below are two triangles. The first one is an<br>
    equilateral triangle. The second is an isosceles<br>
    right triangle.</p>

    <p>Your answer to the previous exercise turns out to be
    tremendously useful. For instance, let’s say that you have a
    triangle that you know to have angles of 30, 60, and 90
    degrees. We’ll call this a 30-60-90 triangle. Normally, you’d

      <p>The following questions are related to a famous puzzle
      called “Buffon’s needle,” which you may want to look up if
      you<br>
      are interested.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. You’re throwing a tiddlywink with a
      4 cm radius onto a floor with square tiles measuring 12 cm on
      a side. What’s the probability that the tiddlywink will make
      it onto the floor without landing on a crack?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Now you’re playing a different
      version of the game, where you throw a needle between evenly
      spaced stripes on the floor. Your needle is 2 inches long,
      and the stripes are also 2 inches apart. Assuming that the
      needle will land at an angle of 72 degrees to the stripes,
      what’s the probability that it will land without overlapping
      any of the stripes?</p>

      <p>Here are some questions about an<br>
      “extreme value” of the sine.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Ask your calculator to tell you the
      sine of an 80° angle. Then ask for the sine of an 89° angle.
      Does this suggest a value for the sine of a 90° angle? Have
      your calculator confirm your guess.</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Using a protractor, draw a right
      triangle with an 80° angle. Then measure the hypotenuse and
      the side opposite the 80° angle. How do they compare? How do
      you think those two sides would compare in a right triangle
      with an 89° angle?</p>

      <p class="problem-part">. Have a conversation with a
      classmate (or friend, guardian, spiritual advisor) about how
      someone might have decided what the sine of a 90° angle
      should be. Remember that our definition of sine as
      \[\frac{{{\rm{opposite}}}}{{{\rm{hypotenuse}}}}\] in a right
      triangle won’t quite work.</p>
